# Scala Introduction
* Scala, short for **Scalable Language**, is a hybrid functional programming language.
* It was designed by Martin Odersky. It was officially released for java platform in early 2004.
* It is both a **Functional programming** and **Object Oriented programming language** that runs on the JVM! 
* It is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object.
* Is a general purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system.  
* Scala compiler compiles your Scala code into **_Java Byte Code_** which can then be executed by the scala command. The scala command is similar to the java command, in that it executes your compiled Scala code.
* Scala has a set of features which differ from Java. Some of these are: 
  - All types are objects  
  - Type Inference  
  - Functions and Objects 
  - Domain Specific Language support  
  - Traits 
  - Closures  
  - Concurrency support
